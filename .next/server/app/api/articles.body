establishments were broken into within a 24-hour period, with security camera footage revealing the culprits stealing cash registers before fleeing in a white sedan.","Shabazz expressed her belief that she was specifically targeted, and that the crimes were committed with the help of someone close to her.","In a televised interview, she stated that the second break-in confirmed this for her, as it involved the same individuals and vehicle.","The footage shows the perpetrators hurling a brick through the glass front door and quickly moving through the store, leading Shabazz to surmise that they are experienced burglars.","However, she suspects that one of her own employees may have provided information to the thieves for a share of the loot.","In her plea for help, Shabazz has turned to social media and encouraged the public to examine the videos closely to identify the suspects by their clothing.","Her Instagram followers have acted as a support system and provided essential clues in piecing together the story.","Although other robberies occurred in the Atlanta area during the same period, Shabazz remains convinced that the same group is responsible for both of her incidents.","She requests anyone with information on the Atlanta and Tucker robberies to contact Crime Stoppers Atlanta at

and injured at two separate illegal parties in Airbnb rentals in Philadelphia on Monday night, highlighting concerns surrounding the misuse of these properties.","The first incident occurred at 9:59 pm in the Kensington neighborhood, where an 18-year-old was shot twice in the abdomen during a party attended by 50 to 100 underage guests.","Police reported that the wounded teen was transferred to Temple University Hospital in stable condition, and the party's booking guest and the property have since been removed from Airbnb's platform pending an ongoing investigation.","Authorities have not yet apprehended the shooter(s) or discovered any weapons at the scene.","In less than two hours after this event, at 11:50 pm, a second shooting took place at a rented property on North 29th Street in Brewerytown, where about 30 to 40 young people gathered to celebrate.","As police arrived at the scene, they found a panicked crowd fleeing the property, with a 13-year-old girl lying outside, suffering from a gunshot wound to her right buttock.","The girl was transported to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in stable condition.","Additionally, an 18-year-old male with a gunshot wound to his left leg was privately transported to Temple University Hospital, where he was also placed in stable condition.","No arrests have been made or weapons recovered in connection with this shooting, and suspects remain unknown.","An Airbnb spokesperson condemned the senseless violence and reiterated the platform's ban on parties, adding that the company is investigating the North 29th Street incident and has removed both the booking guest and the property from the platform.","Concerned neighbors spoke out about the dangers of Airbnb rentals being used for illegal activities, with one individual describing it as a persistent issue that 'needs to be addressed'.","The recent incidents reflect the continuing challenge Airbnb faces in enforcing its party ban, which was implemented last year to prevent such unauthorized use of its listings.","As part of its efforts to combat this trend, Airbnb has introduced reservation screening and established a neighborhood support

students","article":["An Idaho judge has denied a request from around two dozen news organizations to lift a gag order in the case of a man accused of stabbing four college students to death.","However, the gag order was significantly narrowed in response to the organizations' concerns.","District Judge John C. Judge said in the nondissemination order that any prosecuting attorneys, defense attorneys, and their agents, along with attorneys representing witnesses, victims, or victims' families, are prohibited from making extrajudicial statements (written or oral) that could have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.","Judge ruled that preserving the right to a fair trial necessitated some curtailment of the dissemination of information in the case, which is allowed under the law.","He also noted that the original gag order was ‘arguably overbroad and vague in some areas’.","The revised order is ‘narrowly drawn to prohibit only extrajudicial statements that have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing’ this case, and includes specific examples of what speech is prohibited and what is allowed.","Attorney Shanon Gray, who represents the family of the victim Kaylee Goncalves, unsuccessfully requested exemption from the amended order.","The judge reasoned that Gray, as an attorney, could have access to confidential information about the case that would be prejudicial if released to the public.","Gray has accused the prosecution of keeping the Goncalves family in the dark, and mentioned that the communication between the two parties was the poorest he had seen in his 22 years of experience.","The accused, Bryan Kohberger, 28, is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and burglary in connection with the stabbing deaths in Moscow, Idaho.","The judge noted that Kohberger is ‘potentially facing the death penalty if found guilty’.","The bodies of the four victims, University of Idaho students Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20, were discovered on Nov. 13, 2022 at a rental home across from the University of Idaho campus.","Kohberger was a graduate student studying criminology at Washington State University.","In January, Latah County Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall issued the sweeping gag order, and earlier this year, 30 news organizations challenged it, arguing that it violates First Amendment rights.","However, the high court declined to weigh in and said the coalition should first ask the lower court to lift the order.","Wendy Olson, the attorney representing the media coalition, expressed satisfaction with the court's decision to significantly narrow the nondissemination order, noting the importance of both the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights and the First Amendment rights of the press in providing transparency in the criminal justice system."],"date":"2023-06-25T15:39:21.446Z","time":"16:39:21","images":[{"image_alt":"Idaho judge presiding over the Bryan Kohberger case, taken with Canon EOS 5D Mark IV","image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1122530950853701692/1122550204579717242/KappaKoppa_Idaho_judge_presiding_over_the_Bryan_Kohberger_case__fc4a3d50-a3fc-40c3-8a74-b18bb33bf674.png\r","_id":"64985fa9dda8a17b9e7e4402"},{"image_alt":"Attorney Shanon Gray, representing the Goncalves family, speaking in the Latah County courtroom, taken with Nikon D850","image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1122530950853701692/1122550747742077018/KappaKoppa_Attorney_Shanon_Gray_representing_the_Goncalves_fami_8e387e22-6d5f-469b-a791-f2786b697942.png\r","_id":"64985fa9dda8a17b9e7e4403"},{"image_alt":"University of Idaho campus, near the location of the crime, taken with Sony Alpha a7R III","image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1122530950853701692/1122551282780094494/KappaKoppa_University_of_Idaho_campus_near_the_location_of_the__a96e6f5f-311f-4d07-b408-94b9fc4e1778.png","_id":"64985fa9dda8a17b9e7e4404"}],"audio_link":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1122530895186899015/1122551477932671087/merged_audio.mp3","keywords":["Bryan Kohberger","Idaho judge","gag order","nondissemination order","stabbing deaths","college students","University of Idaho","First Amendment rights","Sixth Amendment rights","fair trial","extrajudicial statements","Latah County","death penalty","Shanon Gray","murder","burglary","news organizations","gag order appeal","crime","court"],"__v":0},{"_id":"649883a7602f4e40ba91f2ee","category":"U.S.","sub_category":"Crime","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/active-shooter-reported-weirton-west-virginia-police-scene","headline":"Active Shooter Reported in Weirton, West Virginia;

gone by since the tragic death of Christian Caldwell, the 18-year-old brother of renowned political analyst Gianno Caldwell, in a Chicago shooting.","Despite the passage of time, no suspects have been arrested in connection with his murder, leaving the grieving family desperate for answers.","On the night of June 24, 2022, Christian was one of three victims shot on the South Side of Chicago.","Although the other two victims sustained injuries but survived, Christian lost his life, out with friends at the time.","As the investigation hit the one-year mark, Gianno Caldwell publicly called for the FBI to take over the case.","He expressed his lack of trust in the ability of the Chicago Police Department and county prosecutor, Kim Foxx, to handle the case properly.","In recent years, Chicago has experienced a surge in violence, with 291 murders and 1,137 shooting incidents last year compared to 271 murders and 1,074 shootings so far this year.","Despite the fact the police department has managed to solve about 50% of homicide cases annually in recent years, Christian's case remains unsolved.","According to Gianno Caldwell, there has been little progress, and he also called on Congress to hold soft-on-crime prosecutors accountable.","Eugene Roy, a former officer with the Chicago Police Department for over 30 years, offered insight into why cases like Christian's often go unsolved.","He explained that witnesses are often too afraid to come forward due to fear of retaliation and the realization that the system cannot protect them.","Roy also noted that diminished proactive policing in Chicago and a lack of cooperation from the state's attorney are contributing factors to unresolved cases.","Since March 2020, the department has lost more than 1,400 officers, according to an analysis of data from the Inspector General's office.","For Gianno Caldwell, the fight for justice continues, not just for his family, but for the countless families in

Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, well-known for its Doomsday Clock initiative, published an article in June titled 'Queering nuclear weapons: How LGBTQ+ inclusion strengthens security and reshapes disarmament'.","This publication has gained recognition from its Doomsday Clock, an estimation of how close the world is to a catastrophic event based on various geopolitical factors, such as the war in Ukraine, the 2017 inauguration of President Trump, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and climate change concerns.","In a section labeled 'Queer theory: changing the narrative', the authors assert that queer identity informs theories that aim to alter the manner in which officials, experts, and the public perceive nuclear weapons.","Queer theory, defined as a field of study closely linked to feminist theory, examines norms around sex and gender.","According to the article, the queer lens emphasizes the rights and welfare of people over abstract ideas of national security and challenges the mainstream understanding of nuclear weapons.","The writers also point out that nuclear deterrence discourse tends to be highly gendered, often linked with concepts of 'rationality' and 'security', whereas disarmament and justice for victims are regarded as emotional or lacking in an understanding of 'real' security mechanics.","The piece cites the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp, a 19-year protest against the storage of US nuclear missiles in the United Kingdom.","Many participants in this camp recognized that male-dominated power structures contribute to both the oppression of women and nuclear armament.","The protesters used feminine-coded symbols, such as pictures of children, as a way to emphasize nuclear weapons' existential threat rather than the protection they purportedly offer.","Rejecting binary thought that sees nuclear deterrence as providing security and disarmament as generating vulnerability, queer theory encourages envisioning a world where nuclear weapons are not needed.","However, the article also highlights the importance of queer theory for spreading awareness of marginalized groups' struggles in a cis-heteronormative society.","The authors

and increased potential for suicide.","The policy of Middletown school district, for example, mandates that teachers and administrators must now inform parents if their child starts using a different name, pronouns, or a bathroom inconsistent with their sex.","Platkin emphasized that the actions of these schools, if allowed to persist, would lead to harm and severe risk to the students' safety.","On the other hand, Middletown Board Counsel Bruce W. Padula, contests the narrative constructed by the Attorney General, stating that their policy treats all students equally and is not discriminatory.","Padula adds that Middletown's policy ensures that if any student, regardless of gender identity, seeks to change their school records or requires counseling, parents would be duly informed.","Similar provisions can be found in the policies of K to 8 districts of Marlboro and Manalapan-Englishtown, albeit with slight variations regarding when parents are notified and whether school professionals are included in discussions.","According to Platkin,

develop a drag persona while engaging in queer theories related to performance practice.","Taught by Nino Testa, who himself embraces the drag persona Maria von Clapp, the class aims to explore drag performance, the history of queer art of drag, and examine drag's role in social critique, pedagogy, and queer worldmaking.","The syllabus highlights the importance of questioning traditional binary gender norms and embracing a more diverse understanding of gender.","Under the guidance of Testa, students will meet with drag performers, experts, and generate their own drag personas, later showcasing their creations at TCU's Annual Night of Drag.","As part of the coursework, each student must create a one-to-two-minute solo drag performance, which will be recorded, edited, and shared with a broader audience at the Annual Night of Drag event on April 21.","Throughout the course, students will explore various readings and videos, including works such as 'Drag Pedagogy: The Playful Practice of Queer Imagination in Early Childhood' by Harper Keenan and Lil Miss Hot Mess, 'Drag Kids', and 'Queer Childhoods and Drag Race' by Mary Zaborskis.","Featured discussions will cover topics like 'The Gender Binary is a Tool of White Supremacy' by Kravitz Marshall, and 'How Drag Villains Became the Far Right’s Ultimate Villains' by Colleen Hamilton.","The course will also cover the

York City Spends $50K to Resettle Migrants in Florida, Texas, and Abroad","sub_headline":"114 migrant households relocated between April 2022 and April 2023","article":["New York City reportedly spent around $50,000 between April 2022 and April 2023 to resettle 114 migrant households in various US states and other countries.","According to data obtained by Politico, the top three states were Florida (28 households), Texas (14), and North Carolina (6), while five households were relocated to countries like Peru, China, Ecuador, and Venezuela.","The existence of such transportation programs is not new or hidden; the city announced the formation of Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Centers in September, providing migrants with settlement options through family connections across the country and beyond.","New York City Mayor Eric Adams has previously noted that migrants were compelled to come to the city, but with assistance, some have chosen to move to other destinations, including Canada and warmer states.","This information comes at a time when Adams and other Democratic leaders have criticized the governors of Florida and Texas for their resettlement programs, transporting migrants to sanctuary jurisdictions like New York City, Washington D.C., and California.","Critics argue that Republican governors are weaponizing immigrants as political stunts and misleading migrants to get them onto the transports against their will, while the governors deny these claims and maintain that the transports are voluntary.","Nevertheless, this new information raises questions about the ethics of relocating migrants and the complexities of managing migrant populations in different parts of the country.","Border states like Texas insist they need to protect their communities from the influx of migrants, and argue it is justified to send them to sanctuary jurisdictions that support the very policies they believe are causing the crisis.","In the meantime, recent figures from Customs and Border Protection reveal that there were over 204,000 migrant encounters at the southern border in May alone, totaling over 1.6 million encounters for the fiscal year."],"date":"2023-06-25T21:54:58.090Z","time":"22:54:58","images":[{"image_alt":"New York City Mayor Eric Adams speaking at a press conference about the migrant relocation program, taken with a

upheld a law that criminalizes the act of encouraging or inducing illegal immigration, rejecting claims that the provision was overly broad and unconstitutional.","The case, U.S. v Hansen, centered on Helaman Hansen from California, who falsely promised hundreds of noncitizens entry and a path to citizenship through 'adult adoption', a method that does not actually exist under U.S. law.","Hansen

used their life savings to pay for Hansen's deceitful scheme.","Convicted of both fraud and encouraging illegal immigration, Hansen challenged his sentence on the grounds that the law was too broad, a claim that the district court dismissed.","The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Hansen, arguing that the law on encouragement violated the First Amendment's free speech clause.","However, the supreme court majority disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's verdict, as Justice Barrett countered that Hansen needed to demonstrate that the statute prohibited a substantial amount of protected speech outside its legitimate scope, and that the unconstitutional applications were disproportionate to the law's valid applications.","Ultimately, the court ruled 7-2 against Hansen, finding that he did not meet these criteria.","In their dissenting opinion, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson cited the concerns of various groups including lawyers, immigration advocacy organizations,

Alejandro Mayorkas, accusing the administration of providing unlawful categorical parole.","Parole, intended for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, has been employed by previous administrations for various purposes, such as assisting migrants fleeing Cuba and Vietnam, and preventing the deportation of illegal immigrant family members of military veterans.","However, the Biden administration's extensive use of parole has provoked criticism from conservative opponents.","Earlier this year, the administration was obstructed from employing the 'Parole + Alternatives

dates due to overcrowding—was similarly blocked by a federal judge.","In response, nearly 6,000 migrants were released under this policy.","Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials have argued

Administration Targets Hunters with New Regulations: 'Preventing Americans from Hunting'","sub_headline":"Experts claim latest restrictions will 'create substantial cost barriers' for hunters across the country","article":["Safari Club International’s Ben Cassidy highlights concerns over the Biden administration's recent push for tighter hunting restrictions.","On Thursday, the administration announced plans to enforce prohibitions on specific types of equipment permitted for use by hunters on federal refuges, eliciting strong objection from sportsmen groups.","The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) unveiled the 2023-2024 hunting and fishing rule — an annual regulation detailing the forthcoming hunting season — which aims to ban cost-effective lead ammunition and fishing tackle in eight national wildlife refuges by 2026.","Though supported by environmental organizations, hunters contend that such prohibitions could amount to a covert assault on hunting in general.","Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, criticized the FWS, accusing them of establishing regulations that punished hunters and undermined conservation funding without definitive proof of negative impacts on wildlife populations.","Keane further claimed that the administration had disregarded scientific evidence to fulfill an anti-gun and anti-hunting agenda.","Experts and sportsmen associations have repeatedly accused the Biden administration of targeting hunters and fishers through regulatory measures.","Under the proposed FWS rule, as of September 1, 2026, sportsmen will be barred from using lead ammunition or tackle in eight federally managed refuges across various states.","In justifying these restrictions, the FWS cited the 'best available science,' indicating the detrimental effects of lead equipment on human health and wildlife.","The organization's 2022-2023 hunting and fishing rule, finalized in September 2022, had only prohibited lead ammunition in the Patoka National Wildlife Refuge in southern Indiana.","Benjamin Cassidy, a former senior Interior Department official, stated that while the Biden administration sought to take credit for expanding hunting and fishing access on public land, the lead ammunition and tackle bans were, in fact, counterproductive.","Cassidy warned that these bans created significant cost barriers for sportsmen and women, preventing Americans from hunting and fishing on public lands.","Back in 2021, the Center for Biological Diversity, an influential environmental group, sued the federal government over a Trump administration rule that expanded hunting and fishing access across more than 2 million acres.","Rather than defending the rule, the Biden administration in February 2022 requested the court delay proceedings and eventually reached a settlement with the group, agreeing to take measures to protect wildlife potentially harmed by expanded hunting and fishing.","As part of the settlement, the FWS committed to expanding lead ammunition restrictions within the 2023-2024 annual rule proposed last week.","American Sportfishing Association's Mike Leonard expressed deep disappointment in the continuation of unmerited and damaging restrictions on tackle usage.","Leonard emphasized that any restrictions on lead fishing tackle ought to be grounded in solid science proving an impact on specific wildlife populations, and developed in conjunction with state fish and wildlife agencies.","Despite repeated requests for evidence from the FWS, the association has yet to receive anything to substantiate these restrictions.","Hunting groups are urging Congress to expediently pass the Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act, legislation introduced by Senator Steve Daines and 22 other Republicans in April, which would prevent the FWS, Forest Service, and Bureau of Land Management from banning lead ammunition or tackle without scientific support."],"date":"2023-06-26T00:04:29.465Z","time":"01:04:29","images":[{"image_alt":"Sportsmen discussing new hunting regulations while examining their equipment, taken with Nikon

ten minutes of inspection time would have made a world of difference.","The former engineer also revealed that during his time on the job, reduced inspection times and rest periods for rail crews made the job considerably more dangerous and stressful.","Norfolk Southern has reportedly laid off over 20,000 workers across the industry since 2019 due to the implementation of Precision Scheduled

resulting from the clawback process.","The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs counters that they are required to recoup the grant awards under federal law.","While the state has temporarily halted collections, those already notified about the clawbacks are still burdened with liens that would be deducted from any future property sales.","Worryingly, some homeowners face clawbacks and liens even though their houses have not yet been rebuilt.","The New Jersey Organizing Project has been lobbying for legislative action to forgive the clawbacks for nearly 1,500 affected families.","In

harsh winter conditions, the mission would likely be the only manned dive to the Titanic in 2023.","Shortly before the Titan began its descent on Sunday morning, the crew boarded the submersible – Harding, Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Sulaiman, OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, and an unidentified OceanGate pilot.","Sealed into the vessel with 17 bolts, the craft contained enough oxygen to last the crew 96 hours.","Just over an hour and a half into the dive, contact was lost with the submersible.","The U.S. Navy's top secret acoustic detection system picked up sounds consistent with an explosion or implosion, but this information was not deemed definitive at the time.","As the hours ticked by, rescue efforts expanded to cover 10,000 square miles of ocean.","With oxygen supplies dwindling, the U.S. and Canadian coast guards, along with the private sector, sought to locate the missing Titan.","After several days of searching, the Canadian vessel Horizon Arctic sent a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) which discovered a debris field.","Officials confirmed the debris was consistent with the catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber, leading to the tragic deaths

Black-owned areas, as well as disparities in business licenses, education, and healthcare.","Chaired by Dr. Karcheik Sims-Alvarado and appointed by the county's Board of Commissioners, the task force has 14 members.","It is still early in the process to determine the form of reparations, which could include direct cash payments to affected families, financial assistance or tax cuts to Black-owned businesses, subsidies for home-buying, or various other forms.","Regardless of the measures taken, the task force aims to be transparent with public funding and has employed an independent contractor as a fiduciary agency.","Addressing the controversial nature of reparations, Russell said, 'It's very complicated... How do you determine who receives compensation, and who should pay for it?'","While opponents of reparations argue that it only divides races further, Russell maintains that their mission is to identify those who were treated unjustly and let the commissioners decide the appropriate remedy.","Russell emphasizes the need to eventually move forward, stating, 'At some point, people have to just get past this issue.'","Reparations have been a hot topic in recent months, with advocates like Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., proposing a $14 trillion plan to compensate for past racist policies.","The reparations movement is gaining momentum nationwide, despite its unpopularity with a majority of Americans.","The Fulton County task force's recommendations are due by October 2024, in the lead-up to the next presidential election."],"date":"2023-06-26T02:55:08.313Z","time":"03:55:08","images":[{"image_alt":"Taken with Canon EOS 5D Mark IV: Mike Russell, a Fulton County Reparations Task Force member, intently studies historical documents at his workstation, representing the investigation into the county's past.","image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1122530950853701692/1122720177281319053/KappaKoppa_Taken_with_Canon_EOS_5D_Mark_IV_Mike_Russell_a_Fulto_27cc7366-b7e7-44e4-874b-5e39dfe401ed.png\r","_id":"6498fe0c602f4e40ba91f447"},{"image_alt":"Taken with Nikon D850: A diverse group of people engaged in discussion around a large conference table, depicting the Fulton County Reparations Task Force in session.","image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1122530950853701692/1122720795848867982/KappaKoppa_Taken_with_Nikon_D850_A_diverse_group_of_people_enga_ca59a4dd-0dd1-4456-b7ca-949970a5b9c2.png\r","_id":"6498fe0c602f4e40ba91f448"},{"image_alt":"Taken with Sony Alpha a7 III: An aerial view of modern-day Buckhead in Atlanta, showing present-day development in an area investigated by the Task Force for past land grabs of Black-owned properties.","image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1122530950853701692/1122721418430394499/KappaKoppa_Taken_with_Sony_Alpha_a7_III_An_aerial_view_of_moder_92ffe625-7110-49d1-a057-e4607952f233.png","_id":"6498fe0c602f4e40ba91f449"}],"audio_link":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1122530895186899015/1122721571455381514/merged_audio.mp3","keywords":["reparations","task force","Fulton County","Georgia","Mike Russell","racial progress","past wrongs","slavery","Black population","compensation","financial atonement","investigation","history","controversy","land grabs","Jim Crow laws","disparities","Commissioners","recommendations","Rep.

state's universal preschool program is unconstitutional.","The school claims they are being forced to abandon their religious beliefs in order to participate.","According to senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) Jeremiah Galus, this requirement sends a message that religious families are considered second-class citizens and that religious beliefs are unimportant.","The Colorado Department of Early Education mandated that to participate in the universal preschool program, which will provide at least 15 hours per week of state-funded preschool services to every four-year-old in the state, a school cannot hire employees based on its religious beliefs.","ADF is a legal advocacy group dedicated to protecting First Amendment rights, and they are representing DPCA in their lawsuit.","The bill for the new preschool program contains two discrimination clauses forbidding participants from discriminating based on various factors including religion.","Although religious schools are not banned from participating, DPCA claims that the program's provisions would negatively affect their ability to uphold their faith-based values, which are central to their hiring and employment decisions.","DPCA and other faith-based schools requested a religious exemption, but it was denied by the state's early education department.","In response, the Christian school filed a religious discrimination lawsuit on Tuesday against Colorado state officials.","Galus points to recent Supreme Court decisions asserting that the government cannot exclude religious organizations from generally available government benefit programs.","For example, the Supreme Court ruled in Carson vs. Makin that government programs cannot exclude students attending religious

D'Arienzo emphasizes that one of the biggest psychological challenges in such a situation is dealing with uncertainty, and it is crucial for the passengers to focus on what they can control.","Being calm, getting to know each other, and conserving oxygen by limiting conversation are some of the strategies the passengers can employ.","The submersible tour, offered by OceanGate Expeditions, claims to have life support that can sustain five people for 96 hours.","Recent updates estimated that approximately 41 hours of breathable air remain within the Titan sub.","Dr. D'Arienzo highlights that the situation is more difficult for civilian passengers who lack the training of naval submariners.","Among the passengers confirmed on board the Titan are wealthy Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, his son Sulaiman Dawood, UK's Hamish Harding, and OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush.","For the families awaiting news, Dr. D'Arienzo advises them to stay together, focus on what is within their

basketball team was accused of racism for their actions following a championship game against Orange Glen High School, a mostly Hispanic institution.","In the game's aftermath, the teens were condemned for throwing tortillas at the opposing team, an act that led to widespread outrage and the eventual stripping of their championship title by the California Interscholastic

game, but a 40-year-old man named Luke Serna with ties to critical race theory advocacy groups.","His actions resulted in two excited JV players throwing tortillas in the air, leading to immense public backlash and instigating a race-based narrative, despite the incident being a thinly constructed and easily disproven claim.","Pressure from racial justice organizations like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and others was quick to descend onto the town, with inflammatory rhetoric branding the entire team as racist.","Meanwhile, school board members prematurely deemed the event an act of 'racism, classism, and colorism', casting judgment on the innocent young athletes.","In the midst of this Kafkaesque power play, members of the community fought for truth and due process, refusing to succumb to the manufactured narrative.","Their efforts ultimately led to the removal of those sweeping claims from the school board's statement, though the championship title and sanctions on the athletic teams are still being withheld.","Stories like this serve as reminders that there is much to learn from upholding truth and refusing to perpetuate falsehoods in the name of

honor by civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Ralph Abernathy - appears to have lost its way.","Critics of the bill, including Georgia State Rep.

voting even with a 50% majority, no parliamentary elections if presidential elections fail in the first round, and the establishment of an interim government before elections.","Without finding common

destabilization.","In the aftermath of Moammar Gadhafi's fall and downfall in 2011, Libya has been plagued with turmoil as rogue militias and foreign governments have supported rival administrations

inquiry, former UK Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged that the country had made the mistake of focusing heavily on preparations for a flu pandemic, rather than considering other types of pandemics in the years leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Cameron, who was at the helm of the UK's Conservative government from 2010 to 2016, was the first politician to be questioned in the extensive inquiry into the nation's readiness for the coronavirus pandemic, the government's response, and the lessons that can be learned for the future.","The United Kingdom suffered one of the highest COVID-19 death tolls in Europe, with the virus being recorded as the cause of death for nearly 227,000 individuals.","Speaking under oath, Cameron conceded that during his time in office, officials were too narrowly focused on the risks posed by an influenza pandemic.","He stated that not enough questions had been asked about the possibility of other highly contagious respiratory diseases emerging.","Cameron revealed that despite his government investigating other pandemics like MERS and SARS, it failed to probe deeper into asymptomatic transmission and the high infectiousness of the virus that would become the global pandemic.","While admitting that many other countries were also caught off guard by the pandemic, he argued that the UK performed better than most in monitoring potential risks and planning for a pandemic scenario.","Cameron also refuted criticisms that spending cuts to public services under his government left the UK's National Health Service (NHS) highly susceptible to the pandemic.","Earlier, the British Medical Association had claimed that Cameron's austerity measures had inflicted lasting damage on public healthcare and hindered prioritizing the nation's health.","The official inquiry, expected to last three years, is led by a retired judge, with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior politicians anticipated to face questioning in due course.","This comes as the UK government's handling of the pandemic has once more come under scrutiny following allegations that Johnson misled Parliament about

agreement from Russian President Vladimir Putin.","Over the weekend, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's office revealed that he had spent most of his Saturday negotiating the deal between Prigozhin and Putin, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.","As a consequence of the agreement, Wagner forces ceased their advancement towards the Russian capital, averting a potential conflict.","It remains undisclosed what, if any, concessions Putin made to persuade Prigozhin to desist in his march.","Meanwhile, Peskov announced that Wagner soldiers will not be charged for their actions on the battleground, adding that those who were not involved in the rebellion would go on to sign contracts with Russia's defense ministry.","However, experts such as Dr. Ivana Stradner, a
