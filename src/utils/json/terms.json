            "description": "Headline Horizon ('Company', 'we', or 'us') has developed these Terms of Use to dictate the terms governing your use of headlinehorizon.com and any other URLs, mobile applications, platforms, and services that might be introduced or associated with Headline Horizon in the future (collectively termed as 'Company Sites'). The spectrum of services rendered by the Company on these Sites may encompass messaging, videos, RSS feeds, podcasts, mobile functionalities, text messaging campaigns, and any other applications, features, or content we might introduce sporadically (collectively, the 'Company Services'). Our Company operates out of the United States, and the Company Services are primarily hosted here. We present the Company Sites and the Company Services for your individual pleasure and amusement. On accessing the Company Sites or using the Company Services, even if you aren't a registered member, you are agreeing to abide by this Agreement, inclusive of future changes ('Agreement'), and to comply with all relevant laws, rules, and regulations ('Applicable Law'). Please go through this Agreement diligently. We reserve the right to revise this Agreement anytime, and each such revision will be effective immediately upon its appearance on the Company Sites. Such changes will have a prospective effect. Should you continue to use the Company Sites or Services post a revision, it will be considered as your agreement to the modified terms. Hence, regular reviews of this Agreement are essential. If any of these terms are not to your liking or if you can't comply with Applicable Law, you should stop using the Company Services at once. Accessing some Company Services might be conditional, based on your adherence to this Agreement which may include our Privacy Policy and any user license agreements that might come with the Company Services. There could be certain services demanding you to agree to additional terms and conditions or necessitating downloads of software or content. Should there be a conflict between such terms and this Agreement, the additional terms would hold precedence. A CRITICAL POINT TO NOTE is the 'ARBITRATION AGREEMENT' section. It contains terms stipulating that (i) with a few exceptions, all disagreements between you and the Company related to this Agreement will be resolved through binding arbitration instead of a court, and (ii) both parties relinquish the right to initiate or participate in class-action suits concerning these disagreements. Please familiarize yourself with the Arbitration Agreement by accessing the appropriate section. By utilizing our website and accepting this Agreement, you're concurring with the Arbitration Agreement."
